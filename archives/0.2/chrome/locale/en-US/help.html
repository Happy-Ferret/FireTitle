</a><h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p><a name="Introduction">FireTitle allows you to control the text that appears in the title bar of your Firefox windows.</p>  

<p>You can specify this in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>give each window its <a href="#NamingWindows">own name</a>, which appears in the title. (You can also choose a pattern that does not display the window name).</li>
<li><a href="#ChangingTitlePattern">specify a pattern</a> to format the title bar. </li>
</ul>  

<p>Because most operating systems and window managers let you browse through your windows by title (using mechanisms such as Alt-Tab and the system tray), naming each window makes it easier to find the window you are looking for.</p>

<p>While the features of this extension may be fun and useful
under a variety of different browsing styles, it was designed to
empower the use of multiple browser windows, each of which contains
multiple tabs grouped by functionality.  Users who run Firefox with
multiple profiles get even more value from fixed text that you can specify on a per-profile basis.</a></p>


</a><h3><a name="NamingWindows">Naming the current window</a></h3>

<p>The simplest thing you can do with the FireTitle extension is give a window a name.  As you type in the new name of your window in the <a href="#AccessingOptions">Options dialog</a>, the <strong>Title Preview</strong> section shows you how this affects the title of your window. By default, the name of the window appears in the title bar before whatever normally displays. If you don't include the window name in the title pattern, this string won't appear in your window title.</p>


</a><h3><a name="ChangingTitlePattern">Specifying global settings</a></h3>

<p><strong>Setting a title pattern</strong></p>
<p>The FireTitle extension replaces Firefox's default title bar text with text determined by a pattern you specify. Here is a list of
the available pattern elements, and what they mean:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>n</strong></td>
<td>window <strong>n</strong>ame</td>
<td>The name of the browser window.  One way to name a window is to explicitly name it, as
described in </a><a href="#NamingWindows">Naming Windows</a>.  Another way
is to use the modified <a href="#OpenInTabs">Open in Tabs</a>
functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="alt"><strong>t</strong></td>
<td class="alt">document <strong>t</strong>itle</td>
<td class="alt">The title of the page in the browser(in the window or the
active tab), as determined by Firefox.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>m</strong></td>
<td>document <strong>m</strong>odifier</td>
<td>The standard text in the title bar, such as "Mozilla Firefox Beta 1".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="alt"><strong>a</strong></td>
<td class="alt"><strong>a</strong>ge of the window</td>
<td class="alt">how long ago the window was created (in minutes or hours or days).  Useful if you know you want to find that window that you just opened (assuming your other windows
had been around awhile before you opened it).</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><strong>w</strong></td>
<td><strong>w</strong>hen the window was opened</td>
<td>This is basically the same information that age provides.  I find
age more useful (and less verbose), but this option is here, if you
prefer it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="alt"><strong>[<em>text</em>]</strong></td>
<td class="alt">the text string</td>
<td class="alt">If you want to put a piece of text into the title of every window,
enclose that text in square brackets.  If you want to use a close
bracket character <strong>]</strong>, you need to use two brackets <strong>]]</strong>.  <br><br>This might
be a little confusing, but don't worry: The <strong>Title Preview</strong> section will show
you what it thinks you are trying to display, and will show you
errors if it is confused.  This functionality can be especially
helpful if you run Firefox with more than one profile.  Simply put a
distinguishing piece of text in the pattern in each profile, and you
can tell at a glance which windows are running in which profile.</td>
</tr>

</table>


<p>You can also place the following two modifiers just after a pattern element to change its behavior:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>number</strong></td>
<td>maximum length</td>
<td>The preceding element's value will be limited to the first
<em>number</em> characters.  For example, <strong>t10</strong> will display at most
10 characters from the document title.  This is clearly more useful
for some elements (such as title) than for others (like fixed text),
but it is implemented for all of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="alt"><strong>!</strong></td>
<td class="alt">always display</td>
<td class="alt">Some elements can, at times, not produce any text. For instance:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>a</strong>
element does not produce anything until the window is a minute old.
Using <strong>a!</strong> will display <strong>0 minutes</strong> instead of displaying nothing.</li>
<br>
Some pages may not have a title, as far as Firefox is
concerned. 

<li>The <strong>t</strong> element will not display anything in these
situations, but <strong>t!</strong> will display <strong>(Untitled)</strong>.</li> <li><strong>n!</strong> will
display <strong>UNNAMED</strong></li>
<li><strong>m!</strong> will display <strong>NO MODIFIER</strong>.</li>
</ul>  If you find it
disconcerting that the title is occasionally missing a whole segment
of text that you are accustomed to seeing, try using this
modifier.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>To emulate the default behavior of Firefox with respect to titles, you
could set the pattern to <strong>tm</strong>.  This would still change the <a href="#OpenInTabs">Open In Tabs</a> behavior, but step <a href="#OpenInTabsstep3">3</a> of that
process would have no effect.</p>

<p>FireTitle's default pattern is <strong>ntm</strong>.  In other
words, FireTitle simply prepends the name of the window to the title text.</p>

<p>When you change the title pattern in the Options dialog and click <strong>OK</strong>, that change is propgated to all open windows.</p> 

<p><strong>Setting the default name for new windows</strong></p>
<p>You can set the default name for new windows you open as you are browsing as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows has no name by default</strong> - new windows use only the title pattern</li>
<li><strong>Use opening window's name by default</strong> - new windows use the name of the opening window in addition to the title pattern</li>
<li><strong>Use opening window's name/title by default</strong> - new windows use the name and title of the original window in addition to the title pattern.  This feature is somewhat verbose, but sometimes the context from which you opened a window is useful in determining what content the window contains.</li>
</ul>



<p>As you change the title pattern in the Options dialog, the Title Preview section shows you
what the title of your last window would look like with the given
pattern.  It tends to ignore what it can't understand (although any
errors will appear in the error text area), and is not terribly
fussy.</p>

<h3><a name="OpenInTabs">Using the Open in Tabs feature</a></h3>

<p>The FireTitle extension attempts to make it very easy do group
related tabs in a window and find that window quickly.  One of the
more powerful ways in which it does this is to modify the <strong>Open in
Tabs</strong> functionality available from the <strong>Bookmarks</strong> menu.</p>

<p>If you use the <strong>Bookmarks</strong> menu, select a folder, and
then select <strong>Open in Tabs</strong> from the submenu, the behavior
is different from the Firefox default behavior. </p>

<p><img src="chrome://firetitle/skin/openintabs.gif"></p>

<p>The FireTitle extension does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creates a new window (as though you had hit Ctrl-N).
</li>
<li>Opens each of the bookmarks in the folder in its own tab in that new window.
</li>
<li><a name="OpenInTabsstep3">Assigns the name of the bookmark folder as the  the window name.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>Open in Tabs</strong> feature lets you group pages that you open often in windows by function so that the window that holds those pages has a useful name every time you open the pages.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is another <strong>Open in Tabs</strong> feature available from the context menu (right-click on some platforms; Ctrl-click on others) within the
Bookmarks menu.  <em>FireTitle does not change the functionality of
this menu item.</em>  You can still use this <strong>Open in Tabs</strong> option to
destructively replace any tabs you might have open in your browser
window with one tab per bookmark. It will not change the name of that
browser window.</p>

<h3><a name="AccessingOptions">Opening the Options dialog</a></h3>

<p>There are three ways to open the Options dialog.  It is bound to the ';'
accelerator key (Ctrl-; on Windows or Linux, Command-; on Mac).
You can also to click the FireTitle icon
<img src="chrome://firetitle/skin/ft.png"> on the toolbar.
(If this icon doesn't appear, just right-click on a toolbar and and choose
<strong>Customize...</strong> to open the Customize Toolbar dialog.
Then drag the FireTitle icon to a toolbar and click
<strong>Done</strong>).</p> 

<p>Or, you can choose <strong>Tools > Extensions</strong>,
then highlight the FireTitle extension and click <strong>Options</strong>.</p>
